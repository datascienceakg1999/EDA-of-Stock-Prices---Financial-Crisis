Facet plots, also known as trellis plots or small multiples, are figures made up of multiple subplots which have the same set of axes, where each subplot shows a subset of the data.

In this faceted area plot we can see all the banks separately.


fig = px.area(bank_stocks.xs(key='Close', axis=1, level='Stock Info'), facet_col="Bank Ticker", facet_col_wrap=2)
fig.show()
