A Bollinger Band is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to user preferences.

When the bands tighten during a period of low volatility, it raises the likelihood of a sharp price move in either direction.
When the bands separate by an unusual large amount, volatility increases and any existing trend may be ending.
Prices have a tendency to bounce within the bands' envelope, touching one band then moving to the other band. You can use these swings to help identify potential profit targets.
